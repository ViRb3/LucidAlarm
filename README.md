# LucidAlarm
An alarm that can briefly wake you up at given intervals.

## Features
* Alarm start time
* Custom alarm sound
* Ring count
* Ring duration
* Ring interval

## Notes
Due to *Doze*, a battery preserving feature introduced in Android 6.0, any app is not allowed to wake up the device more than once every 9 minutes. This limitation breaks the ringing interval functionality, therefore the app will require you to excempt it from *Battery Optimizations (Doze)* before it can work.
